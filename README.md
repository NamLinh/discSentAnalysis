# discSentAnalysis
Analysing the general sentiment of any given text channel, or potentially server.

This project requires the installation of the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) library.


## Purpose
The general idea behind this project is to utilise an entire server's message history, in conjunction Large Language Model to understand the general sentiment of the server, over some user-defined period of time. The motivation, or goal. is to analyse the mental health of a server's userbase, and is particularly useful in understanding a small community, or friendship group.

Whilst a human can probably recognise this if they're analytical enough, this is mainly to be used over periods of time, over a long period of time. E.g. checking in on the user-base over the course of a month, over the course of a year to see if the general feelings of a user-base have gotten more negative / positive over time. 

Whilst some communities can be "ironically" depressed and make jokes to do with dark topics, these tend to indicate deep-rooted negative mindsets anyhow, and so I don't expect factors such as this to impact the overall results of this project.
